## UMAP, or Uniform Manifold Approximation and Projection, is a machine learning method by which we can generate visuals which may (or may not) predict the likelihood of a gene being upregulated, downregulated, or more related to another gene of interest. There are important rules and limitations to using this approach; tips can be found in McInnes, L, Healy, J, UMAP: Uniform Manifold Approximation and Projection for Dimension Reduction, ArXiv e-prints 1802.03426, 2018

# Load new_results (if you haven't kept them from the second .Rmd):
```{r}
new_results <- read.csv(file = "log2foldchange_2_p-value_05.csv", header = T, row.names = 1)
results.labels <- row.names(new_results)
```

# Set seed and UMAP parameters:
```{r}
set.seed(1111)
umap.defaults

# UMAP parameters set to default:
# n_neighbors = 15, min_dist = 0.1

# low n_neighbors values will push UMAP to focus more on local structure by constraining the number of neighboring points considered when analyzing the data in high dimensions, while high values will push UMAP towards representing the big-picture structure while losing fine detail.

#  Larger values of min_dist will make UMAP pack points together more loosely, focusing instead on preserving the broad topological structure
```

# Run this again if you don't want to use assay values:
```{r}
dds <- estimateSizeFactors(dds)
sizeFactors(dds)
normalized_counts <- counts(dds, normalized=TRUE) # Use for UMAP later
normalized_countsdata <- write.csv(normalized_counts, file="normalized_counts.csv", quote=F)
normalized_counts[is.na(normalized_counts)] <- 0
```

# Make sure to transpose normalized counts before running the next chunk:
```{r}
normalized_counts <- normalized_counts %>%
  t()
```

# UMAP might look prettier if we included all replicates for each neuron type
```{r, echo=FALSE}

print(custom.settings)

## UMAP notes:

## The coordinates of UMAP output for any given cell can change dramatically depending on parameters, and even run to run with the same parameters (Why setting the seed is important). This means that you should not rely too heavily on the exact values of UMAPâ€™s output.

## One particular limitation of UMAP is that while observed clusters have some meaning, the distance and density between clusters usually does not. The fact that two clusters are near each other should NOT be interpreted to mean that they are more related to each other than to more distant clusters.
